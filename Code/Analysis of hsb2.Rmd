The hsb2 data are demographics and test scores for a random sample of high school seniors in the nation. This will be an analysis of those scores.

To pull data from Data folder, need to use here function
```{r include=FALSE}
library(here)
```

### The relationship of SES to math performance

```{r include=FALSE}
hsb <- read.csv(here("Data", "hsb2.csv"))
```

Here are side-by-side boxplots of math scores by SES levels.

```{r echo=FALSE}
hsb$ses <- factor(hsb$ses, 
                   levels = c(1:3),
                   labels = c("low", "middle", "high"),
                   ordered = TRUE)

boxplot(hsb$math ~ hsb$ses,
        xlab = "SES Category",
        ylab = "Math Test Score",
        main = "Math Test Scores by SES Category")
```

Here are the five-number summaries, means, and standard deviations.

```{r echo=FALSE}
tapply(hsb$math, hsb$ses, fivenum)
tapply(hsb$math, hsb$ses, mean)
tapply(hsb$math, hsb$ses, sd)
```
